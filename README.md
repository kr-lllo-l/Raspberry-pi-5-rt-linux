# Raspberry Pi 5 Real-time OS with Buildroot (rpi5-buildroot-rt)

A Buildroot project to build a **real-time Linux system with the PREEMPT_RT patch** for the Raspberry Pi 5. This configuration provides a minimal, stable base for high-performance applications requiring low and predictable latency, such as robotics, industrial automation, and real-time audio processing.
